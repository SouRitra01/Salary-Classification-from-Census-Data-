# Project Title: Salary Classification from Census Data using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview:
I recently completed a project that aimed to classify the salaries of individuals based on their census data. The project involved training a logistic regression model on a dataset of census data, and then using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen individuals.

## Objective:
The objective I set for myself was to build a model that accurately classifies the salaries of individuals based on their census data, such as their age, education, work class, and occupation. I trained and tested the model on a dataset of census data, and evaluated the results to determine the accuracy of the model.

## Methodology:
Here's how I approached this project:

- Data Collection: I collected a dataset of census data, including information on individuals' age, education, work class, and occupation.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: I trained a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model using accuracy metrics, such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Model Deployment: I used the trained model to classify the salaries of new, unseen individuals based on their census data.

## Expected Results:
The expected results I achieved were an accurate model that can classify the salaries of individuals based on their census data. I evaluated the model's accuracy and deployed it for making predictions.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I successfully completed a project that classifies the salaries of individuals based on their census data using logistic regression. The results of this project can be useful for employers, recruiters, and policy makers who are interested in understanding the relationship between census data and salary. The model I developed can help them make more informed decisions based on salary classifications.
